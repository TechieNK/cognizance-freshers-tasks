To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop or Git Kraken. 

## Basic Operations

> The following is a summary of basic git operations:


### git add

	Puts current working files into the stage.

------

### git checkout 

	Replaces the current working files with files from a branch.

------

### git checkout -b

	Creates a new local branch from the current branch's tip.

------

### git clone

	Clone an existing repository into a new directory.

------

### git commit

	Commits staged changes to a local branch.

------

### git commit -a

	Commits all modified files to a local branch (shorthand for "git add" followed by 
	"git commit" for each modified file)

------

### git fetch

------

### git merge

	Merges files from a given branch into the current branch.
