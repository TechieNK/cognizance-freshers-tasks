## What is Self Learning?

Self-learning is anything you learn outside a classroom environment by yourself without a set curriculum or examinations.

Unlike traditional methods of schooling, your self-learning efforts are not measured by how well you perform in an exam. Self-learning lets you gauge and improve your knowledge via practical applications with no matriculated evaluation. This makes it all about pure learning.

## Why Self learning?

* Self-learning helps you develop your problem solving skills.
* Self-learning is stress free. There are no exams, no deadlines. Only pure satisfaction and curiosity being answered.
* You gain secondary skills that will help you advance your career.
* Self-learning comes out of your personal desire to learn something new. Thus, you get a feel of accomplishment and get a purpose to learning.
* You get to choose the way you learn. You can find your comfortable medium, videos, texts, experiments or webinars, and other diverse mediums can be efficiently used to learn.
