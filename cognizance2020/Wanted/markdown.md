## What is Markdown Language?
>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

## How do I use Markdown language?

> 1.Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application.	
  
> 2.Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.

> 3.Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.

### HEADERS
Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext and atx. 

Setext-style headers are “underlined” using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers).

------
# This is Heading 1  

## This is  Heading 2

###### This is Heading 6
------
### BLOCKQUOTES  
  Markdown uses email-style > characters for blockquoting. If you’re familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a > before every line:

------
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,

> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse

> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
